		  			<p>Put in Great Expectations, then put it on the map. Flag the estuaries of the Thames. Have you read Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle? If so there's another Thames connection. Ever got to be in a row boat on the Thames. Now you've got Dickens and ostentatious rowers on the same map. Maybe drop a flag in the Liffey for the time you got to row in Ireland. Put in another flag for Beckett's tower in western Ireland. Put in a flag for the pub down the road that served amazing grilled cheese sandwiches. Put in the recipe for grilled cheese sandwiches. Link to stories of the well remembered grilled cheeses of your youth. Or mozarella on your trip to Italy & Disco Fondu parties. Not resonating for you? That's because it's mine. Your's is waiting.</p>
