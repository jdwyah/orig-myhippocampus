tour.title=MyHippocampus - Tour
tour.1=MyHippocampus is...
tour.0.0=On a mission
tour.0.1=At MyHippocampus our mission is to take your ideas, knowledge, & influences and let you connect, visualize & store them in a way that turns them into building blocks, resources which you can draw upon to aid your creative endeavors.
tour.1.0=A way to visualize knowledge
tour.1.1=Folders full of .doc's are for modern day Kafka enthusiasts. MyHippocampus let's you find information in a more human & humane way.
tour.1.2=To do this, we've thrown out the desktop metaphor. Instead of files & folders, the atom of our system is a topic in a topic map, which, like your brain, focusses on the relationships between topics. We engage your spatial & temporal memory to help you visualize & organize your topic maps. 
tour.1.3=Create your own virtual mental landscape. Some concepts don't fit on the map of this world, but spatial location isn't just for the real world anymore! Don't worry if this sounds complicated. It's easy, and building your virtual mental landscape will make you swear off folders forever. 
tour.1.4=View timelines of everything. A bodybuilder's mirror for your intellectual life. How many books did I read last year? Visualize your progress throught the canon and your goal of finally becoming 'well-read' starts to feel a little more doable.
tour.1.5=See how your topics relate to each other in time. After she crushed your will to live which books did you start reading? Interesting. Start to notice patterns. Start to avoid the old mistakes.  
tour.2.0=A way to connect to literature
tour.2.1=Put in Great Expectations, then put it on the map. Flag the estuaries of the Thames. Have you read Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle? If so there's another Thames connection. Ever got to be in a row boat on the Thames. Now you've got Dickens and ostentatious rowers on the same map. Maybe drop a flag in the Liffey for the time you got to row in Ireland. Put in another flag for Beckett's tower in western Ireland. Put in a flag for the pub down the road that served amazing grilled cheese sandwiches. Put in the recipe for grilled cheese sandwiches. Link to stories of the well remembered grilled cheeses of your youth. Or mozarella on your trip to Italy & Disco Fondu parties. Not resonating for you? That's because it's mine. Your's is waiting.
tour.3.0=A place to think more interesting thoughts
tour.3.1=No To-Do lists. No shackles. No news-reader feeds. No manacles. No ads. This is your space. A place for thoughts that move at a different speed.
tour.4.0=A way to remember what's really important
tour.4.1=Only take with you that which you truly want.

manifesto2.title=MyHippocampus - Manifesto 2
manifesto2.1=Exempli Gratia.
manifesto2.1.0=E.G.
manifesto2.1.1=What really makes your hippo tick is when you find can use it to help you remember connections between disparate parts of your life. We present Exhibit A.
manifesto2.1.2=You have an idea for a company that sells hand-knit sweaters with pictures of famous poets, thinkers and luminati on them. Who doesn't need a Proust sweater? What happens now. Well what happens now is you say to	yourself "that's neat" and maybe you remember it for a couple weeks	and bring it up as a topic of conversation in your knitting circle, dive bar, faculty meeting, but then it is forgotten and the world is deprived of their nice sweaters.
manifesto2.1.3=With MyHippocampus it's a much happier story. You create an island called "Ideas for Jobs that are better than the one I've got." Give it some space in your ocean by dragging it (this tends to become a very big island.) Now add your new idea as a topic on this island. The island grows. This represents fortune smiling upon you. Perhaps you want to enter some specific ideas of which authors to start with. If so you can add an entry to this topic. Easy as that.
manifesto2.2.0=The Growth
manifesto2.2.1=Now we fast forward 1 month. You're reading the New Yorker and there's some funny article about beatnick sweater makers in Park Slope that make haut couture sweaters & sell them for big bucks. Interesting. Add a 'New Yorker' island. Add the article and make the connection.
manifesto2.2.2=Another month goes by and the charming Mainer on the airplane next to you is in charge of grants for programs improving children's experience in libraries. Add her and put her on the islands of 'People,' 'Grant Givers'  & 'Mainers.' Add a connection from her to your new idea... maybe you can get some money to put small children in Spinoza sweaters.
manifesto2.2.3=You read something about the Brooklyn bakery that works with the chronically unemployed and produces world class cakes. Throw it in your hippo. You finish Le Temps Perdu. Who doesn't want a Proust eating the darn cookie sweater? Into the Hippo.
manifesto2.3.0=Corduroy & Kafka
manifesto2.3.1=So I'm sure you can see where this story is going. You get the grant, the business explodes, riches & social awareness for all et cetera. Dress your family in corduroy and Kafka. But perhaps that's not how it turns out...
manifesto2.4.0=Or...
manifesto2.4.1=Maybe you decide to move this idea from the island of 'Good Venture Ideas' to the island of 'Good Professions for Characters in my Novel.' Just like that the thought transfers from the Sea of Non-Fiction to the Estuary of Fiction. This is the point of MyHippocampus. You've got ideas, facts and connections rattling around inside your brain, but sometimes we feel like the guy in Memento, as though we can only remember things for a fleeting momemt. Instead of tatoo-ing good ideas on our body, let's extend our capability to remember the good stuff by using this new-fangled InterWeb. A place to offload those good thoughts & insights that aren't pertinent to today? That's MyHippocampus. 
manifesto2.4.2=Eventually you've got islands filled with various people you've met, ideas you've had, and concepts you've run across. Who can I ask about what laptop to buy? The island of nerds knows. Who can I get to design my logo? The island of Design Eye for the Design Impaired knows. How many books did I read last year? What are all the resources I've come across that deal with 'Disorder'?

manifesto1.title=MyHippocampus - Manifesto
manifesto1.1=Our Manifesto
manifesto1.1.0=Rant Part #1
manifesto1.1.1=When you take a look at your life, you may find that the bits worth remembering are... worth remembering. You may also find that you're forgetting them.	So this is an opportunity to remember things. Your analysis of Karl Marx for example. You really thought it was spot on and insightful, but that the folks at wikipedia won't let you sneak in to the definition. Damn tyrants ;) Or perhaps the revelation you had that your friends father looks uncannily like that pig farmer from Babe, James Cromwell. Important stuff like this is worth remembering. It will make you chuckle in the future. So what if we can record these events, as a stick in the ever-moving mud-flats of knowledge? 
manifesto1.1.2=Think of it as a little way to say 'I was here.' A body builder's mirror for what's going on in our brain. It may not be all that important wether you've read 12 or 200 pieces of South African fiction, but what matters is that the number was not 0.
manifesto1.1.3=Record these things and in time you'll notice the synergies that exist in your collection. Your oevre. Perhaps you'll synthesise two disparate parts of your experience and think of something truly unique. Might it change the world? Does it matter? This is not intended as a repository of reviews or a public facing blog, so much as an inner monologue stenographer.
manifesto1.2.0=MyHippocampus
manifesto1.2.1=MyHippocampus is a personal intellectual tool.
manifesto1.2.2=We hope it will help capture your insight into the world around you. Your insight into your world.
manifesto1.2.3=It is not about accumulation of factoids, although it is adept at this. Insight is the goal, but sometimes insight needs to emerge out of well organized clutter, since we never know what facets of our imagination or experience we will require to come to our next conclusion.
manifesto1.2.4=So make sure to add enough clutter.
manifesto1.2.5=5 points will be awarded for in depth reviews of foreign films.
manifesto1.2.6=500 points will be awarded for humorous supreme court justice anecdotes.
manifesto1.2.7=5000 points will be awarded for late night insight into the post-modern signifigance of the movie title "Snakes on a Plane"
manifesto1.3.0=Responsibility
manifesto1.3.1=MyHippocampus is a powerful tool, and like all tools it needs to be used with some care, lest it become another foot soldier in the battle for a share of your conscious mind.
manifesto1.3.2=Above all, do not let this become another burden. Are you slogging away adding an entry for every piece of romantic poetry you've read? Every bottle in you cellar? Every chemical in the periodic table? Forget it. Add what you want to read. The definition for "Watermelon Environmentalist" (green on the outside, but pink in the middle) is worth 10 times the points. The wikipedia exists, use it.
manifesto1.3.3=MyHippocampus works very well as a blog, but think carefully about using it this way. Sharing with the outside world is interesting and somewhat thrilling, but consider making it a diary first and foremost. Then you can share the insights you truly want to be public.
manifesto1.3.4=What's that you say? Is it possible that the 'My' in <em>My</em>Hippocampus has very little to do with another famous 'My'.com? Yep, that's the idea. What sort of 'My' do you want? Maybe this Internet is good for something besides spam, socializing teenagers & shopping after all.
manifesto1.4.0=Selfishness
manifesto1.4.1=Being a little selfish in your protection of your intellectual life is certainly not the worst thing in the world. To paraphrase Morrie "do not buy the culture" that isn't working for you. Whatever it is that you actually do like, write that down here. 
manifesto1.4.2=Think of it as a little way to say 'I was here.' A body builder's mirror for what's going on in our brain. It may not be all that important wether you've read 12 or 200 pieces of South African fiction, but what matters is that the number was not 0.
manifesto1.5.1=Hmm... this isn't really very clear, can I get an e.g.?
manifesto1.5.2=You sure can...
