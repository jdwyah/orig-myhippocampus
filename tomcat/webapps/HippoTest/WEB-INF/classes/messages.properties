manifesto2.title=MyHippocampus - Manifesto 2
manifesto2.1=Exempli Gratia.
manifesto2.1.0=E.G.
manifesto2.1.1=What really makes your hippo tick is when you find can use it to help you remember connections between disparate parts of your life. We present Exhibit A.
manifesto2.1.2=You have an idea for a comany that sells hand-knit sweaters with pictues of famous poets, thinkers and luminati on them. Who doesn't need a Proust sweater? What happens now. Well what happens now is you say to	yourself "that's neat" and maybe you remember it for a couple weeks	and bring it up as a topic of conversation in your knitting circle, dive bar, faculty meeting, but then it is forgotten and the world is deprived of their nice sweaters.
manifesto2.1.3=With MyHippocampus it's a much happier story. You create an island called "Ideas for Jobs that are better than the one I've got." Give it some space in your ocean by dragging it (this tends to become a very big island.) Now add your new idea as a topic on this island. The island grows. This represents fortune smiling upon you. Perhaps you want to enter some specific ideas of which authors to start with. If so you can add an entry to this topic. Easy as that.
manifesto2.2.0=The Growth
manifesto2.2.1=Now we fast forward 1 month. You're reading the New Yorker and there's some funny article about beatnick sweater makers in Park Slope that make haut couture sweaters & sell them for big bucks. Interesting. Add a 'New Yorker' island. Add the article and make the connection.
manifesto2.2.2=Another month goes by and the charming Mainer on the airplane next to you is in charge of grants for programs improving children's experience in libraries. Add her and put her on the islands of 'People,' 'Grant Givers'  & 'Mainers.' Add a connection from her to your new idea... maybe you can get some money to put small children in Spinoza sweaters.
manifesto2.2.3=You read something about the Brooklyn bakery that works with the chronically unemployed and produces world class cakes. Throw it in your hippo. You finish Le Temps Perdu. Who doesn't want a Proust eating the darn cookie sweater? Into the Hippo.
manifesto2.3.0=Corduroy & Kafka
manifesto2.3.1=So I'm sure you can see where this story is going. You get the grant, the business explodes, riches & social awareness for all et cetera. Dress your family in corduroy and Kafka. But perhaps that's not how it turns out. Riches and social awareness for all.
manifesto2.4.0=Or...
manifesto2.4.1=Perhaps you move this idea from the island of 'Good Venture Ideas' to the island of 'Good Professions for Characters in my Novel.' Just like that the thought transfers from the Sea of Non-Fiction to the Estuary of Fiction. This is the point of MyHippocampus. You've got ideas, facts and connections rattling around inside your brain, but sometimes we feel like the guy in Memento. Let's extend our capability. Let's offload good thoughts that aren't pertinent to today, but let's stop losing them. 
manifesto2.4.2=Eventually you've got islands filled with various people you've met, ideas you've had, and concepts you've run across. Who can I ask about what laptop to buy? The island of nerds knows. Who can I get to design my logo? The island of Design Eye for the Design Impaired knows. How many books did I read last year? What are all the resources I've come across that deal with 'Disorder'?
